	One participant comes from Latvia; says that the natural world and green spaces have always been important to them and their home city is even more green than Sheffield. Often sits outside on benches watching the world go by.  
	Enjoyment of parks and green spaces but a barrier is feeling tired every day so having the energy to go outside is hard.

	Questions whether people appreciate the natural world more when they have been away from it?  
	Nature as a space to calm the mind: especially the peak district and local parks in Sheffield.  
	Current disconnect between the outdoor city and poor transport and connectivity. We need to walk the walk.
