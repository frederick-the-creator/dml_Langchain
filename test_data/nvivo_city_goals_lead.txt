In a world of abundant ready-made entertainments, how do we foster creativity and imagination?
	Need to see humility with those in power, transparency, and acknowledgement that 'we don't know'.
	"Around climate I crave strong leadership" - it's not there. 
	How to make time for anything. How can we slow down, enable young people to slow down? Check space for new ideas. 
	People from minority backgrounds need to be on boards where decisions are made: excluded, unable to take part. 
	For trust, people need to be less fearful - have time. (enable connection to the local... more secure living).
	We have issues with the council trusting us to do things for the city'.
	Trust: understand the city leadership as humans, break down the distance.
	Can we drip-feed info on the why and how of decision - making better.
	Cities assemble for imagination and curiosity, not scrutiny... no commitment to it.
	Can we use empty buildings as new spaces for democratic decision-making.
	Big businesses in Sheffield.... very few.
	Local politicians engage relatively well where they live... but uninformed about transversal themes (mental health/food).
	In the age of disinformation, how can we build trust at a community level... build fertile ground for collective action.
	City leadership and fellow citizens have come out of a rough patch - tree felling.
	Local area committees are good but not fully started yet. 
	Humans, not organisations make the difference - humans with resources that happen to be within organisations.
	You have to invest to enable people to be heard... and processes need to be genuine and influence decision making. 
	What if every decision was made with young people/the next generation in mind.
	How can decisions be announced in a more distributed way... not just at city hall.
	Huge change in council structure recently... but no impact on the residents. 
	Quality of leadership has been poor. Council needs to step back and let communities indicate priorities/lead the change.
	City has felt directionless for a very long time.
	Basic principles - residents leading change local level first, support for participants enabled through flexible regularity, but we have a very top down city.
	Lots of communities doing great stuff but from a strategic perspective very limited in influencing decision-making, Sheffield did not embrace big local groups.
	Neighbourhoods want to work with the council but doors are not open. 
	Networked neighbourhoods governance - 142 neighbourhoods empowered.
	People living in Sheffield all their lives but do not feel they are Sheffielders.
	Funding - power. no fairness or equity in funding.
	Why are parks in different areas not managed or maintained equally.
	Different areas have differing priorities - survival mode vs. leisure focus.
	No glue points where community assets are richer.
	Migrant communities dumped in sink sites /forgotten - lack of amenities. denial of racism.
	Unsafe working conditions and exploitation of migrant workers by warehouses and factories.
	Weaponization of funding accessibility/restricted resources/funding threats.
	What is the strategy for Pitsmoor? Why is it not thriving?
	Where do Black and Brown Sheffielders work in Sheffield (not visible in Tesco/Sainsburys).
	Is Sheffield attractive to investors?
	Alternative grassroots ways to empower communities - Sheffield's radical past/history forgotten.
	All outstanding secondary schools located in specific areas - gifted children in poor areas have no chances.
	Disparity in wages/knowledge and skills.
	Reliance on charity, lack of sustained support.
	Who is the landlord for many properties in Sheffield - are they investing in their diverse communities? 
	Money/distribution class/social mobility, racism and discrimination opportunity/access education.
	Over reliance on public sector and voluntary in Sheffield - where is the private sector.
	Sheffield's economy is public sector - money belongs to communities but gatekeepers are hindering fair flow/distribution.
	Political environment is unstable with no long term focus.
	Broomhall S3, very diverse and extreme, very segregated.
	Council housing student accommodation £1m mansions nearby but not together.
	Different S3 street lamps for same street.
	London to Sheffield, Birmingham/London Sheffield is great, it's the people, friendly.
	S1 church congregation is changing, attending prayers is essential, mental health.
	S3 not disability friendly otherwise would have stayed.
	Crates in Sheffield city centre is a waste of money.
	S3 people and community make it special - safe space.
	Beyond S3 alien/racism rife.
	No schools in S3 - children travel from safe areas to alien areas - S10-S17.
	Kelham v Burngreave - nearby but disconnected.
	S20 - very green/more attractive space very clean, no fly tipping.
	People/community is valued more highly than green spaces and housing.

	Clear standards and agreed with the community.
	Levels of competence and trustworthiness of councillors.
	Consequences for poor decisions by council leadership.
	How can the community make its voice heard (LACs not working)?
	How do we engage the voices of youth and diverse communities?
	Elected leaders feel more remote from communities - where are the community centres?
	LACs are rubbish - dysfunctional, all chat/no actions or follow up.
	Do leaders really know Sheffield (do they live in the city)?
	What has replaced local pubs for social gatherings?
	Leaders need to be seen and be accessible to communities. 
	Parks and recreation - where are all the park keepers?
	Does Sheffield have a brand?
	Sheffield's standards have dropped - why? contract, tendering accountability.
	Network Rail - Large employers need to be more considerate about surroundings .
	Lego sculptures treasure hunt in the city centre.

	Sheffield as a village.
	Do businesses/organisations help you engage - civil service.

	Ability to engage in shaping the future.
	Keep gun/knife/drug crime out of the city. 
	Not too often - life is busy.

	Things like this.
	Without big time commitment.

	Attending events, speaking to groups, schools etc.
	More parish councils.
	Engaged in having more buses.
	Local councillors are more visible and more accountable.
	Bolder decision making with better accountability.
	Decisions made at the right level - power devolved down.
	National government should delegate more power to the city and region.
	Reassured that decisions aren't being taken by those with time/motive?
	City wide events and debates like the festival of debate where there was opportunity to discuss ideas/experiences.
	Use of digital engagement tools - making it as easy as possible to engage.
	Money - understanding how and why it is being spent.
	Be more ambitious for the city.
	Enabling things to happen more quickly - delegated budgets and more available.
	Easier to block things and slow them than to make things happen - this is an issue.
	Proper consultation - not just listening to the angry voices.
	Leadership to be bold and proudly lead change.
	When there is genuine sense that we're working for the long term greater good, not just short term benefits.

	Money - devolved funding.
	Infrastructure for people to meet and connect and organise change.
	Neighbourhoods need an infrastructure to engage people.
	Sheffield rarely feels overwhelming as a city, it has a real village-vibe. This is also reflected in its physical infrastructure, which doesn’t have as many high-rise buildings, and therefore feels less imposing when you first arrive; this is especially important for students.  
	Feel like everything you need is within walking distance, or accessible via public transport.  
	The city itself had a large influence on participants' decisions to study here at the University of Sheffield; more influence than the course itself.  
	Shared community experiences clearly a core part of being a Sheffield citizen; one participant noted that the musical ‘standing at sky’s edge’ really reflected this to them.  
	One participant said they feel more part of a community in Sheffield than they did in their home-town of only 5000 people. One participant described it as ‘a village masquerading as a city’.  
	Sheffield is family-orientated, kid-friendly, and it's clear to students that many people choose to build their lives here. This is also reflected in the high retention rate (quotes 25%) of students who choose to stay here once they graduate. It feels very student-y, but is still diverse.  
	Participants feel like ‘adopted Sheffielders’ and that they’ve really bought into being a Sheffield citizen during their time at University.  
	Question whether Sheffield people take their sense of community for granted, as it’s quite unique? 
	The focus on independent businesses and local industry makes Sheffield unique and feels different to the rest of the UK (from participants originally from EU countries).  
	Feel proud to be from Sheffield because I was brought up here, because there's lots going on here. 
	Most of the time I have got on with people and I've integrated.
	Sheffield is an arts hub, creative community, they like to welcome people.
	Experience as a Sheffield citizen depends on who you are and where you live, your background etc.
	Different treatment depending on where you live, areas with less integration eg. racial.
	Welcoming place overall; people are nice to everyone.
	Village mentality in the city centre, less so in the outskirts.
	Long standing local politics makes me feel like an outsider.
	Speaking in a climate protest when I was nine everyone was very helpful, adjusting the mic etc.
	Running the half marathon, a huge communal event, and fundraising for charity.
	Setting up the Sheffield Property Association helped by others who wanted to make a positive difference.
	Rebooting Sheffield Chamber of Commerce - nearly everyone in one organisation.
	Supporting schools to improve across the city.
	Climate March - I held a banner and about 5 others helped me carry it.

	Peaceful protests about climate change.
	This! Everyone's helped me feel included and my opinions heard.
	Redoing an allotment with my family and they helped by listening to my ideas to make it wildlife friendly.
	For our Council to lose its passive/aggressive defensive approach when challenged.
	For young people it would be great if under 18s could have a say when people are voting.
	At community level related to real things.
	I want to be engaged with before a decision is made - not just have a decision explained to me.
	By being presented with an idea and a request for support - rather than having to come up with the solution.
	Easily accessible local forum - listened to and acted on.
	By people who are willing and able to make positive difference.
	By people who are confident in what they want but they don't have solution so they are curious.
	I want my thoughts to be noticed and considered not just heard.
	If there is a problem - local or city level for it to be aired and solutions suggested, listened to and acted upon.
	Engaged by people who have authority to take decisions.
	By people who care, not a machine.
	In real decisions at the right time.
	New designs and buildings have public thoughts.
	Despite the friendly city, it takes time to settle.
	Its a creative city.
	We have a strong sentiment towards our infrastructure (Park Hill).
	Individuals should have more engagement with community organisations.
	Show up and show your support.
	Drop ins that encourage leadership from the community - the power is in their hands.
	Hold backs - laziness that could be tackled by motivation, what will motivate communities, initiatives.
	We need to build communities.
	Drop in centre in every community.
	Engage with housing associations - council's reach residents.

	They need to listen to us.
	Things come to action.
	See change in my life.
	Understand that people are confused by/alienated by the council/councils.

	Complicated funding rates.

	People don't know how to access the help they need.
	Leading meetings with public engagement - have that at the beginning, engage people, value that time.
	Fear of not getting it right.
	Meetings are not where the public want to attend - events and engagement.
	LACs/parish level at local level can help unlock and empower.
	Red tape - different boundaries of different organisations e.g lacs and parishes.
	Central hub for funding with someone to talk them through it.
	VAS - use them across the city.
	The university needs to go through fundamental structural change - move beyond faculties & disciplinary silos to project based cross-cutting, interdisciplinary work.

	UoS is guilty of holding them back - research, needs explanation of what and why.

	Community divisions.
	Language barriers.
	Sheffield is a top down city - need a shift to grassroots.

	Sheffield - a place of opportunity + accessible.
	For the first time we are seeing collaboration between business and city council. Recognition on both sides that old days have gone.
	Communication - better - how do we communicate with people?
	Do we matter, for the council, does this area matters and is seen as an area in our city where we should also feel proud of.
	There is a lot of care and culture in Page hall, people genuinely care about each other and are closer than in other areas, because we have shared a similar journey.

	More inclusive school curriculum, museums, schools and institutions. 
	Page Hall residents need to be more involved in decision making.

	Communities should have power to influence education.
	Lack of recognition of the contribution of Sheffield's migrant communities.
	Respect celebration of education.

	LACs - find it very difficult to participate in meetings for areas as LACs are so large, venues not also easy to access.
	Accessing the theatre.
	Too many barriers for people with disabilities. Meetings for LACs not hybrid, only live feed. Barriers with bus passes and blue badges - criteria discriminate.
	Black cabs refusing to go within inner ring road due to Clean Air Zone.
	Too many different rules across different areas in the wider South Yorkshire area.

	How close everything is – park, shops, town.
	Nice buildings, lots of trees, good shops.
	Shops on Heeley Green (Go Local).
	Park, cage (MUGA), U-Mix, shops.
	Wouldn’t change anything.
	The stabbing in the park (a few months ago) made me feel unsafe afterwards, I didn't want to go there.
	Too much litter.
	Worry about younger brothers and sisters getting hurt or in trouble, sometimes I don’t feel safe (on the streets).
	Make the Astro pitches at U-Mix free for everyone to use.
	Come into the school/ youth club to speak to us.
	There is an assumption of young people that we are all going to cause trouble and we are not.
	There is no trust – we need police in every neighbourhood, but we know some people don’t like the police.
	There are 3 types of people in my area 1)The ones who don’t care, 2) the people who hate people, 3) The people who hate people for hating people.
	We don’t know where to go/ who to speak to.
	We don’t think decision makers will take us seriously because we are young.
	We would like a place to be able to write down what we want that can then be passed on to decision makers both online and in a building.
	We need education about politics and to be talking about our future before Y9.
	We would like decision makers e.g. councillors to visit our youth club.
	Family and friends live close by.
	Meadowhall is very close and a good shopping centre. 
	There are some good green spaces in the area.
	I enjoy coming to the Youth club.

	We like our area but there is too much litter/rubbish.
	Most of the people who live there are nice.
	It is a quiet place most of the time.
	There are some good green spaces in the area.
	I enjoy playing football that’s run by Sheffield United in the area.
	There are good schools (primary) in the area, Carfield & Annes Grove.
	They like their area the way it is now except housing could be better in some places.
	Young people found it hard to say what made their area different from others because they have not been to many other areas across the city, and they found it difficult to compare their area of Gleadless to the city centre.
	Honesty and openness.
	Owning mistakes.
	Kindness – there is lots of this in Sheffield to build on.
	Need places and spaces for people to come together, mix and share and build trust.
	Need to share experiences and increase mutual understanding – a chance to share stories.
	Need to be better at celebrating our success.
	Use local high street spaces for different community uses.
	Leadership needs to be demonstrably inclusive.
	Going out to engage, not just tick a box.
	People care about different things, everyone needs to hear that the things you care about matter, or don’t matter?
	How do you get trust and understanding with other communities and see the challenges facing different people in different places?
	Need more of a community feel in our areas – in some areas there is isolation.
	How do we learn from other communities about how to do this well – some are really successful.
	How do we find a balance between tightly knit communities and openness and tolerance?
	Organisations are often held back by targets which drive them away from the transformational change we need.
	Are we clear what we mean by communities?
	Perverse incentives and financial interests – so need to align to incentives.
	Sense of helplessness – do people feel empowered?
	Communities need the large anchor organisations to properly devolve power, money and resources.
	Power - organisations or individual fear of losing control.
	Lack of social cohesion – how to create something to coalesce around.
	Organisations often don’t look like the communities they serve.
	Fear or lack of trust in authority.
	Having a sense of ownership in communities.
	Communities are not static but evolving, and need structure that allow for this.
	Neighbourhoods, communities held back by lack of sense of community, candidacy, legitimacy, sense of pride.
	Empowered by a sense of ownership/candidacy and value.
	Building from the bottom up.
