	Lots of things to be proud of in Sheffield - pockets of things to celebrate and learn from - but it's not easy to know about them.

	LACS v Citizens Assembly.
	Community led, participating in communities, with support.

	Tackling inequalities.
	Long-term goals needed to remove political cycles.
	Independent shops, local green spaces, opportunities to come together, what like about Sheffield.

	visibility of issues in less well off neighbourhoods e.g. rats most obvious in some areas.
	Safe in some parts of the city but not others - not safe going between areas, concern for loved ones.

	There’s a lot of red tape at a city level.

	Segregation based on race and class in the city. 
	Not inclusive as a city.
	Don't get to know about elitist boards and how things work.
	Runs on a who you know basis.
	People are tired and want to speak to those making decisions - glass ceiling.
	Councillors not having voices of the poor heard - divide of city.
	Middle management of city council destroying inner city Sheffield.
	White, stale middle class council.
	People work hard but not being paid fairly - then there are those paid - £250k when those clothes work for free to help the community.
	Decline of castle market and high street - wicker area - don't want to walk in from the east of the city.
	People are losing their voices - only people from the BAME community in the room - have to defend presence in the room.
	Lack of accountability - nothing followed through.
	Too many feasibility studies, not enough feedback or results. 
	Fund good projects - imbalance in funding process, accountability, too long funding to single big infrastructure.
	Why is the city such a South and East divide? Gentrifying areas, poorly resourced green areas in less well off areas, Burngreave.
	Decline - wont get businesses in.
	Sheffield is more diverse now but hasn't accepted that.
	Things promised not delivered -have results and impacts.
	Too many people are doing to communities - not using the good people in communities.
	Neglecting spaces - anti social behaviour. 
	Sheffield has stopped caring about communities - east.
	Race Equality Commission recommendations not carried through - no change, no action.
	Lack of black women leaders at higher executive levels.
	Lack of representation across all sectors - NHS, education, police, public means ignorance and not represented in conversations at high level.
	Stop blaming London and other places - the city centre is run down and reliant on universities.
	Hospitals - declined patient care not equal among communities.
	Heeley Trust going for 20 years.
	Funding models are difficult - have to go with values driven social enterprise.

	Poor local media - negative and backward looking (the star).
	Low wages and low skills compared to other cities - less disposable income.
	Making better use of the tram network - expansion, active travel connections, station shop amenities.
	Repurposing its city centre - away from retail - Sheffield should be ahead of the game on this.
	Climate is too reliant on cars, people moving to areas without growth in resources to support.
	More focus on inter connected neighbourhoods, the city centre becomes just another neighbourhood.
	Building the infrastructure for more city centre living - transport, GPs, schools.

	Energy needs - greater use of local heat networks in the city centre.
	Transport connectivity in between cities especially Leeds to Manchester.
	Lack of confidence in what we can achieve.
	Declining standards means it's hard to take people with you on projects.

	The provision of a great school in my community.
	Community events in local areas or remembrance parades.
	Community centres.
	Limited bus service - does care or turn up!
	Caring = huge impact of no bus turning up.
	Nursery/local school.
	Food markets and community events.
	Crime up, prosecutions down.
	Need to reduce the population so they can get GP/Dentist appointment/into local school, not pave over green spaces by building houses everywhere.
	Family and friends being here.
	Lots of green spaces and chances to be outside even when in the city.
	Impossible to get secondary school places after Y7.
	Visible working groups and engagement.
	Poorly maintained crossings make walking around the city centre feel unsafe/unaccessible.
	The children's hospital is there when you need it.
	NHS not being able to get a Dr appointment.
	Grants to apply for; delegated community budget.

	More high profile events like the women's euros, bring attention to the city.

	Transport costs and connectivity -spokes have to come into town to go out again.
	Transient neighbours impact students and sense of community.
	Driving and parking - very busy.
	Health service.
	Proud that Sheffield is a city of sanctuary and is a space where new communities can form e.g. Ukrainian refugees. Feels like the city of sanctuary is done for genuine reasons, not just publicity.  
	There are positives and negatives of living next to others who aren’t neighbours. Students often get blamed for anything negative happening (such as littering or loud noise).  
	Sheffield allowed one participant to become themself, especially through discovering communities of students where they felt they fit in.  
	Pressure of rental markets, and rising anti-LGBTQ+ and hate speech keep cited as worries.  
	Not many queer spaces in Sheffield, and this doesn’t give confidence in resilience against hate speech. The queer spaces which do exist are grassroots/DIY and often not run by central bodies such as councils.  
	Culture of small village-like places in Sheffield breeds culture of strong and caring communities.  
	Concern that council spent money on coronation over communities - feels out of touch.  
	Feel that because students don’t pay council tax they are left behind and forgotten in local politics - but they contribute in so many other ways, through volunteering over 20,000 hours a year, and giving back to the city, so new avenues should be explored on how students can have more influence in the city. Student representatives especially felt that they have no say and often are ignored by councillors or local MPs when they try to get in touch; conversely, MPs often contact them if it’s something they’re interested in and need support from students.  
	Students in representative roles internalise systemic barriers: they feel responsible for not being able to make change for students, but the real reason is because leaders in local council/MPs don’t listen to them. This means that their job as an advocate causes a lot of stress for them as well as feeling of inadequacy.  
	Sheffield would be better if more resources were spent on celebratory events such as Pride, which is usually facilitated by councils in lots of other cities. Any other ways that the city could celebrate its diversity would also be welcomed.  
	Proud that in Sheffield there are always counter-protests to hateful protests, and that activism is alive in the city.  
	Hillsborough is already an example of a 15 minute neighbourhood.   
	But increasing levels of social isolation due to public sector cuts and public transport links.   
	Safer streets and lower crime levels would make things better. 
	Communities started to meet online during COVID.   
	Developed a forum (Richmond forum) – set up by the community for the community.   
	People worry about cost of living, food on tables, children’s future, public transport implosion, forced to use cars when they don’t want to.  Jobs.  Mental health and isolation falling out from pandemic. 
	Housing is a real issue, renting makes it hard to buy a house.   
	Most people would welcome housing but you don’t get engagement from people who support housing, just those that don’t!  We don’t have a lot of public housing.   
	There are parts of my ward that don’t have a bus service.  Vicious circle – buses are now empty because people have abandoned them.   
	It’s a lot of hassle to use public transport.  I feel like I’m becoming part of the problem now in terms of driving but I didn’t drive until I was in my 40s.  
	Ageing population in Graves – people struggling to get about as they would wish. 
	In 2005 we got European recognition for City in Bloom – involved in people’s gardens and flat balconies.  People like to see nice things – fresh paint, flowers.  Gives more spirit.   
	My ward has fantastic green space but is hard to access for first time buyers.   
	I want to improve things – in Singapore they have plants that absorb gases.   
	Cars are getting better – electric cars for example.  But people want to use their cars.   
	We have a reduction in connectivity in Southey – reducing connectivity on buses, food banks to hospitals and the north of the city.   
	Youth services have been reduced.  Nearly constant problems with youths getting involved in anti-social behaviour.   
	Cost of living crisis – Parson Cross Forum – people saying they are coming to every session to keep warm. 
	Connectivity, youth provision is poor.   
	Very little anti-social behaviour.   
	New housing has created problems with services eg doctors, dentists.   
	Parking is a nightmare. 
	I am really interested in upskilling young people.   
	We need to think about our economic strategy.  Policies from London do not work in SY.   
	Liked to see more joined up thinking with SYMCA.   
	Better digital inclusion.   
	Want to see no food banks.   
	Digital inclusion – we piloted a project in Southey.   
	Linking it with upskilling.   
	We need childcare more available and flexible.   
	Need to improve economic infrastructure.  But people can’t get anywhere without the buses. 
	In terms of community assets.  Parson Cross Forum does a lot for the community.   
	SOAR doing social prescribing and social isolation and keeping people engaged.   
	But the precarious nature of funding.   
	Fox Hill forum and Mount Tabor Church (although they moved the food bank).  Have a dads club.  Lots of social activities.   
	Only two functioning TARAs – many have collapsed in recent years.  They don’t seem to be the focal point that they used to be in the last 10 years.  Loss of community infrastructure. 
	In east Ecclesfield (and west) we have some really good voluntary organisations.  Such as Chapel town in Bloom, High Green, and Ecclesfield in Bloom.  Litter picking groups.  Friends of Chapeltown Park and Friends of Ecclesfield park.  Ecclesfield – the Epic Theatre run by volunteers.  Looking to re-establish a TARA for ‘Chapel Green’.  There’s a lot happening from the residents.  There’s an organisation called ‘Go Chapeltown’ that got funding from ERF.  East Ecclesfield struggling to get into eRF – hard to find someone to take on the role. 
	How do we bring events into the city centre into other areas so people feel part of it?   
	Why do parks have green flags/blue flags in particular areas of the city?   
	Community groups doing work because of lost services funded by the Government.   
	We need to be more strategic – how can we target activities for particular groups not just due to community infrastructure.   
	Sometimes people struggle to have fun – lack stability and income to enjoy life. 
	Looking at promoting buses for particular big events like the jubilee.   
	Housing associations/social housing providers – end up cherry picking.   
	Some areas get more anti-social behaviour from tenants because we (SCC?) house the most vulnerable people there. 
	Children – does it offer my children enough choice?  
	City centre attractions.
	Sense that the city centre does feel safe for young people.
	European parks are often much nicer.
	People in the group – Sheffield was chosen for its metropolitan feel.
	NHS/Health – depends what area you are in, equality is all people treated the same. Dentists are difficult to get into.
	Hospital support.
	Air quality in some areas.
	Council – areas treated differently.
	Pride and place.
	Communities – some communities have pride others just don’t.
	Housing – big high rises blocking the light. 
	Opposing opinions, some want more houses, others don’t.
	We need growth but sustainable growth, not pricing people out.
	Other cities are getting big things e.g. Eurovision (Liverpool), Channel 4 (Leeds). What does Sheffield have?
	Safe places to play.
	Safe places for young people.
	Sports, art, culture.
	Access to parks.
	Relaxation.
	Access to the peak district.

	If I put all the hard work in and still don't get what I want to achieve.
	Keeping friendships positive.
	Communities break down fighting over limited resources.
	The rain worries me - it’s getting harder, same with the wind.
	Work - maintaining high standards for the community with less resources.
	The environment - what the world will be like for my children when they're grown up.
	A2L in school - attitude to learning.
	Work - unachievable demands.
	Climate change.
	Daydreaming at the wrong time e.g. brainstorming new stories.
	Having to pay student fees.
	Jobs in the future.
	Worrying about how we will deal with problems as they get bigger - climate/inequality.
	Diagnosis of autism whether i'll get it or not, whether i even like the word diagnosis.
	Not packing a bag ready for tomorrow.

	Nice and quiet, very friendly, and a great park.
	Because my sister lives there with me.
	Lived there for 25 years (Parson Cross), have good memories of family and growing up.
	The people in Pitsmoor are very nice, it’s a good community.
	The mix of cultures and religions.
	Sense of community in Burngreave.
	Enjoy visiting Spital Hill, seeing the older men sitting outside the cafes, chatting and relaxing.
	It’s unique, all Somali, it’s a bit of a ghetto but easy to make friends – always kids outside playing – and the people who live there are kind.
	It’s very diverse with many nationalities. I like that the shops are open all the time (like on Christmas Day).
	We have a big park (Abbeyfield) great for playing hide and seek.
	I like to play out where I live.
	There’s always someone to play out with.
	Black Pitch Park (?) there’s lots of different things to do.
	I’m proud of the diversity and all the different types of people, we can learn more about each other.
	Lots of parks.
	It is a fun place.
	I live next door to my cousin.
	The cafes on Catherine Road.
	I live near the playground and my Grandad.
	I live next door to my cousin (on Flat Street).
	I get to play with friends and cousins every day.
	Great place to grow up, I live opposite the playground.
	I have fun with my family.
	Somewhere to play with family and friends.
	People give time to each other.
	Adventure Playground! It is a unique place, community spirit, all the children being raised together.
	At the playground adults look out for each other’s children – parents’ chip in and help the staff – adults volunteering at the playground feel empowered.
	Having the playground as a long-standing feature – adults who came as children now bring their own children.
	The playground is a free day out, almost impossible to find anywhere else in the city.
	A lack of community in S12, I travel to the playground as there’s no provision locally for me and son.
	There is less respect now for the older generation.
	No respect among young people for adults they don’t know. It used to be that other adults / elders could step in but doesn’t happen anymore.
	Adults who don’t have a relationship with young people don’t intervene, even when it’s needed.
	People don’t know their neighbours anymore, there’s more division in communities.
	Crime.
	Drugs.
	Making the wrong choices.
	Fights escalating with weapons – young people now carry knives and guns – they don’t realise the dangers.
	Fears for young girls and how they might be seen or treated by strangers on the streets.
	Young girls’ clothes are sexualised.
	Children learning about sex education in school are far too young.
	Teaching LGBTQ+ education in an authoritarian way where children are not allowed to ask questions or make mistakes.
	Parents don’t want children to be ‘exposed’ to ideas around LGBTQ+ - want to control this – conflicts with faith and family values.
	Live life to the fullest - find joy in simplest things - eliminate worry.
	Supportive employers.
	Better equality that will benefit all - we all enjoy the same benefits.
	Absence of a Tory government supports wellbeing.
	Decent public transport infrastructure.
	Access to green spaces.

	Biggest challenge is climate - not enough done about net zero 2030 targets.
	That organised crime gets a foothold in Sheffield.
	Being informed and connected.
	Communities working together.
	Vibrant city centre.
	Great places, housing, chatty cafes, combat isolation - how it helps communities and its issues, give recognition and value.
	Keeping up with the joneses.
	Neighbours all have CCTV - worried about crime.

	This could be improved through a better inclusion strategy and community recognition visibly in the city.

	We don’t have a poverty strategy /crisis for our city, which means that we are not prepared to cover the city’s needs.
