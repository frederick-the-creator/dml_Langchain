	Festivals are key in Sheffield.

	Positioning organisations in the right place to make an impact. 
	For a city of science and manufacturing - where is the science space to get hands on?

	Stop competing with each other and collaborate - transparency is key on rationale and data.
	Safeguarding training for community groups to enable young people's activity.

	Ensuring more young people and diverse people's voices are heard in decision making.
	Not legible - and colleagues make a difference to work?
	What is the offer for young people in the city centre? They need space.
	Connect with the city centre / high street.

	How does SCG fit with regional strategy - too many not joined up strategies.
	Culture delivers economic benefit, builds brand and identity, community and creativity.
	Famous for sporting events.
	Is it possible?
	Communication and positive press and stories about what is good in the city and the cultural assets we have got.
	How do we grow and retain a pipeline of talent in creative industries?
	fuelling students to be more creative and helping them open up and engage and come out of their shell to do all these festivals and socialise and things. 
	I love my job - strategic thinking, control - small charity, keeping people with health issues at work - a really accommodating work environment.
	On the map - connect region and national, internally enabling people to navigate.
	Job - rooted ways in a place that does things - facilitated role.
	Education sector working with students and young people - less paperwork - people - empower students, make sure they are listened to, would be easier with more buy-in from external people.
	Cultural sector/experiences - smaller range and scale and some gaps, little scope for growth in the sector as the finance is so tight.
	Tourists in our own city - students are tourists.
	Build our own city of culture that doesn't come and go but is about sharing Sheffield's future.
	What stops us from aggregating? About the city and having confidence + work that is in a community and making a difference.
	Diverse culture is our thing for everyone - our brand is a city of sanctuary.

	How do we cross fertilise to make it more inclusive?
	Good festivals/events - doc fest festival of debate, cliffhanger, outdoors festival walking festival SHAFF food festival.
	How do we bring people together and organisations together, network the networks, is there an interface?
	Some issues which have been solved in the past are allowed to go in a cycle and the same issue comes up - need sustainability.
	Businesses e.g. leadmill overcome challenges and created workarounds.
	Use the people around this room, around our communities.

	Not fun = property buying.
	Help people! Charity sector work. Anything that means people's lives are improved.
	Journalism, but really anything where no two days are the same, and there’s less repetition and more variety. And wants to feel autonomy in their job.
	Construction for communities: retrofitting buildings or buildings for community spaces, or city-planning!
	The Students' Union is full of creative spaces! There are so many spaces where ideas are shared and students are focused on making change. 
	Graffiti and wall art in the city.
	Music scene and gigs: eclectic range of music.
	Festival of mind.

	Crookes Valley Park to Endcliffe and then bus back to town.
	Local league football matches.  
	Go to a big hill and see a view!  
	Students support the city through civic work and volunteering but it feels like a one way street - what do students get back from the city?  
	Councillors and MPs not responsive to student leaders about the issues students face.  
	‘Good Neighbour Forum’ is not an accessible space for students and student leaders only invited as an observer.  
	Tramlines a major Sheffield event but a shame it’s so expensive now - the free gigs are still some of the best parts.  
	Festival of Debate and Migration Matters as spaces to engage with ideas and  
	Experiencing the city through Sports.
	City Goals should be about our place in the world – didn’t see anything about that?  What are the country’s goals and how do we fit into that?  Our ambitions for the city in the world.   
	Notes the LGA Peer Review. 
	The ability of our residents to contribute to the city and its economic well being and being able to grow and thrive as families.   
	My ward has areas of poverty.  I see young men not finishing school as they see dealing drugs as a better career opportunity and it makes me feel despair.   
	Being on planning, you see applications for sustainable green technology that don’t go through.  We should be seen as risk takers.   
	You used to be able to ask an engineer if you had a problem in Sheffield.  Some of the industrial heritage is important and can still be seen in the fabric of the city.   
	A creative, problem solving dynamic was what we were known for and is still relevant now.   
	Walking through the Peace Gardens when children are playing, being in the city when the snooker is on in a vibrant city centre.   
	When we were going into Objective 2 it was suggested Sheffield was too dependent on heavy industry.  This has changed – we now have a good range of independent businesses and SMEs that add character to the city. 
	I do a lot of travelling abroad and when I say where I’m from – older people know Sheffield for cutlery and steel. Younger people don’t know us. What do we need to promote about ourselves? New things coming on stream – electronic games for example.   
	We need to earn exporting income. In Kelham Island it’s now all housing rather than big exporters. What are we now selling to the world? Outdoor City with a Heart of Steel 
	Yes, a chapter on export strategy in the city goals. 
	You might find younger people elsewhere hear 'Sheffield' and talk about the music scene. 
	Everyone I met in Russia said 'ahh Arctic Monkeys'. Most common response elsewhere normally 'ahh Sheffield Wednesday'.
	However we measure our productivity, we’re not doing well as a city or as a country. It’s not just the last 10 years. I’m in favour of traditional economic measures and wellbeing. When I look around Europe, better distribution of wealth seems to lead to a healthier economy.   
	People want to make a difference and singing from the same song sheet will be important.  But need to go beyond the establishment, and look at decision makers in the economy, beyond the public sector.   
	Proximity to the outdoors is a real selling point. We’ve never quite translated the benefits we have as a city. It has eluded us. 
	Would like to see Sheffield moving towards experiences rather than consumables. Also contributes to the economy.
	Big challenges are climatic breakdown.   
	Amazing cultural offer. We have respected organisations such as the Museums. But we have communities in the city who don’t feel the collections are theirs to enjoy. And the buildings need improving. We take it for granted. 
	Agree with the cultural offer point.   
	Grey to Green you can have a great stroll around Sheffield and come across the unexpected which is great.   
	We’re not missing anything, we're just not unearthing anything.   
	We miss out on connectivity and don’t have common ground with our neighbours.   
	Sheffield gets left out of the conversations on connecting cities.   
	A more inclusive city would be a better place to live in. 
	wellbeing and transport are already thought about. What do we think will change as a result of this approach?
	We had a debate at Full Council – we opposed an amendment about % of renewable energy being community owned. Could affect the overall level of renewable energy. There could be contradictions between policies. 
	Should SCC join the Wellbeing Economy Alliance? 
	Trickle-down economics doesn’t work. Need to invest to save. 
	I would like the Council to provide a framework for growth that doesn’t have a high human or environmental cost. And what happens to the growth once it’s produced – how does it stay in the local economy? 
	Goals: A better place to live, work and enjoy. Making a unique contribution to the country and the world that is recognised and we can be proud of. A stronger economy, richer, more opportunities, healthier, a quality environment, easy to travel around and in and out, better housing, more culture, better sports, stronger community spirit, engaged citizens. Have I missed anything? 
	Ooh my favourite hobby is horses. A cruising ring on the Sheffield waterways, you have to come in and go out.
	Nobody has brought up laissez faire.
	How many businesses in Sheffield are operating with a high human or environmental cost? 
	Also autarky makes everyone poor. 
	I liked going to parks with more amenities. Graves park, Botanical, Endcliffe, Firth park.  Park days out.  
	But it can be hard to get to from certain parts of the city.  
	Sheffield By the Sea.   
	Now evening out but depends on affordability (Crucible, Lyceum not cheap).  Leadmill, West Street Live – but all need to be able to afford and people in Southey miss out.   
	Branded as The Outdoor City – a lot of people choose to come to Sheffield because of the access to the Peak District. But a lot of people from this side of the city can’t take advantage of it.
	a lot of people do not go into the city centre. Prefer meadowhall and Barnsley.
	Could have more events in the North of Sheffield. A lot of people from the north don’t go to the centre.
	‘Go Sheffield’ suggests why can’t we have a fringe during Tramlines – and they can attract funding when the Council can’t.
	In east and west Ecclesfield have good relationships with parish councils – and have community engagement officers. Need more activity to come out to ‘backwaters.’ 
	Sporting facilities,swimming facilities, football (although parking on match days near Wednesday is problematic, particularly for buses).
	Lots of car ownership and moving away from buses.  
	Meadowhall is very popular.
	Well used department stores like Atkinson. The Moor Market is still very popular, particularly the Food Hall.
	Health inequalities need to be a focus. Including access to the dentist at the moment – problem in Southey.   
	Due to be getting an integrated health centre in Southey which should be more accessible than traditional GP buildings.  
	Lack of creative cultural opportunities city wide. 
	Fairness for parity across the city, perception and otherwise. 
	Because retired people can afford it, doesn’t mean it is available e.g. culture, leisure, nature. Do we know what % is retired?
	Can we change some national things, set a Sheffield standard i.e. education system. 
	Goal should be for young people to survive and thrive. 
	Challenge of different neighbourhood priorities (see notion of subsidiarity goal at LAC area) for example, food on table vs better jobs, one area's focus may feel or be explained differently. 
	How empowered are residents e.g. parents and school relationships, build this in city goal (or strategy) and/or local goal, as it may well differ across the city. 
	Lack of engineering jobs.
	Too many small employers.
	People not aware of job opportunities.
	Graduates not staying in Sheffield.
	Connectivity across the city is not there.
	Image of the full monty holds back the city.

	Opportunities for some young people are poor.
	Good things happen in spite of the council.
	City centre parking is very expensive.
	Lack of clear employer pipelines.
	Need to promote Sheffield.
	City that’s falling doesn’t leap.
	Jobs need to be more flexible.
	Lack of dynamic people setting new things up / social enterprises.
	Lack of buzz/excitement.
	Need to promote Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre etc.
	Recycling slow to get going.
	Good place to start a family.
	Local facilities such as toilets, never enough anywhere.
	Inclusive spaces, whole community.
	Access to free facilities/spaces/equipment.
	Funding – sustainable funding/money.
	Governance/structures – red tape and authority, opportunities missed due to time taken to process e.g. bids, connecting across the city.
	How? Pushed from one person to the next.
	Organisations not speaking to each other.
	Screens everywhere to let people know about stuff.
	Support network map.
	Senior decision makers through a consortium type ? example Sheffield Young People’s Consortium.
	Pooling resource.
	Network/team that can support the community to get ideas off the ground.
	Community – make spaces for people to meet like ‘warm spaces’ – keep this going.
