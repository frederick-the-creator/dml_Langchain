Sheffield not looking after people or the planet very well - mental health, transport, NHS, affordability, food.
	The statutory is failing, the grassroots is growing, but patchy and less visible.
	Local plan - 20 minute communities small can be beautiful if it works.
	Covid was transformational self help mutual aid as the system left huge gaps.
	Story of turning around empty buildings.
	Established organisations (third sector) are under huge pressure - not collaborative enough yet to share resources and infrastructure e.g. pressure on salaries.
	Lack of businesses (digital and creative) - is that why young people leave? pre-post university - who leaves?
	Sheffield food strategy, first time it has been all encompassing - economy, health, environment. Lots of buy-in institutions, grassroots.
	Sheffield renewables coop - stumbles on access to council rooftops - governance and partnership issues.
	Better storytelling about the place and Sheffield as a whole - we celebrate too little what's good, it's not in our psyche.
	Food strategy as positive exception - collaborative and well facilitated process, good mandate and focus on inclusion and right leadership (people not institutions).
	How can Sheffield support people more to better connect to local resources - green etc - access.
	Clean aid zone - livelihoods / health lands badly.
	Very small business economy city not very good at growing local SMEs stays small.
	Hold budgets at goal level rather than at institution level. goals to help measure and allocate resources.
	Collaborative steps into food infra sharing in the context of less money. We can be more inventive but there is also huge pressure.
	Hierarchy of needs - a city that doesn't need food banks, public safety and feeling of safety.
	Maintain what has meaning for people in place - for anchoring, keep looking after what you have. Value and care vs neglect.
	Create cycles of disrepair and anti-social behaviour descent into decline and crowd out positive use.
	Kids are frustrated they want to use buses but it's just not working.
	In manor people have stopped calling the police or contacting the councillor - inequity as people have given up.
	Self actualisation and feeling grounded - how does Sheffield build its aspiration.
	Yes we should learn from other places but also leapfrog, do things differently not just repeat.
	What can Sheffield do towards net zero in 2, 3, 5 and 10 years?
	Goals to give us confidence to move forward more quickly.
	Policy infrastructure that doesn't not disadvantage people in net zero transition.
	Buses are important for the community.
	Active neighbourhoods were also introduced badly - could have been a positive story about co-design.
	Fair - affordable - sustainable - what’s the balance?
	What does net zero look and feel like? Articulate to people so they can connect to that as a vision.
	Small has always been a trait of the economy - even the knife trade was about small businesses.
	Radically different public transport - autonomous uber smaller shuttles. more frequent, responsive and reliable.
	Businesses want to move to net zero but don't know where to start - an infrastructure to help them to start the journey and share experiences.
	Sheffield has always been a bit small, not the big money - from wool trade etc. buildings are small.
	Sheffield should actively learn from other UK/EU cities on net zero journey.
	ULEZ should not have gotten to the negative discussion that it became.
	Sharing net zero capabilities - knowledge, supply chain conversations.
	Where are the little meisters? The Made in Sheffield brand had a very strong, strong story, attached to a funding pot.
	One of the biggest forge pits in Europe but not owned by the British.
	We don't need to compete - we can't have a city centre with Meadowhall but that's fine/good.
	Stories as a hook, branding, history for Sheffield, e.g. Made in Sheffield.
	Cities themes to help build our shared identity but also help connect (less chaotic).
	Making Sheffield more investable with compelling stories e.g. sheffield theatre biggest outside London.
	Reimagining spaces, retelling stories of Sheffield.
	Economics is driving a bland city (london, b'ham, mcr). need a slower burn eg. go to York for quirks, river, independence.
	Stop trying to copy Leeds, Manchester etc. Let Sheffield be Sheffield.
	Trusting and inspiring leadership that enables communities.
	Bold action needed on climate change - not just council, but private sector too.
	Social isolation - why an issue? Covid - e.g. students not going into the dining room, older people fear of groups.
	We are a city of two halves - affluence and poverty. We need to create opportunities.
	How can we all be citizens of a place - not just a bunch of logos.
	Economically inactive - endemic.
	Sheffield holy city - city of potholes - example of lack of investment in the city, poor confidence/low pride in the city.
	Local businesses closing - less community involvement.
	Amazing people and places doing great work but lack of investment.
	Physical fragmentation makes the city feel disjointed.
	Sustainable funding holds us back from maintaining our story.
	Not looking at the richer areas - back to front houses - kitchens at the front.
	Celebrating ourselves, not just focusing on the economics, but also providing financial support.
	Decline of steel making industry, no reinvestment cycle. marketing teaching no roles for jobs - bring the people investors in, keep people in centre, it is a 15 min centre.
	No logos over everything, more community, more collegiate, driven by disperate funding pots - big organisations are okay but smaller companies need to make their voices heard.
	Shape of the city centre is awkward, Fitzalan Square on its own - need to link areas, lost the connection between these.
	Narrative of fear - we need to move from no you can't to yes we can.
	Built environment not delivering on net zero, how to attract investment while taking climate action.
	Detachment from city industry/business - steel owned by foreign companies.
	Connectivity of different areas, series of villages.
	Why aren't we plastic free?
	How can we thrive on being different from other cities?
	Number of quarters in Sheffield e.g. gothic detail, learning areas, need clusters e.g. Attercliffe olympic legacy.
	Make Sheffield's history and story visible everyday - reinvention as well.
	Different places have different challenges.
	Net zero/climate change responses in neighbourhoods need to be responsive and collegiate.
	Need opportunity for those who don't typically have it.
	Sheffield has lost its confidence, leeds has taken its place, wouldn't take a stranger to Sheffield city centre.
	Can we better connect and coordinate what the city has to offer?
	Decency and humanity about Sheffield.
	Level of empowerment goal - no party politics at a local level.
	Reimagining spaces, retelling stories.
	Sheffield where people use public transport.
	City lacks good communication but also good listening of communities - and celebration of positives.
	Sheffield city centre not designed well - village, 15 min neighbourhood.
	What connects Sheffield as a city of villages?
	Sheffield feels like a chaotic place to live - disjointed.
	Feeling of shame about the city centre.
	City needs a culture of encouragement to take ownership of the climate effort.
	Needs 'things to do and have' - more venues for medium sized, always something there but not quite getting there.
	Their part of the city, how communities take ownership of their spaces, not just the city centre.
	Social isolation whether affluent or deprived.
	Show positive stories of the 142 neighbourhoods - encourage, represent. articulate the goals - big society didn't work, gaps between the council and community are closing.
	How do we join neighbours - gap between A and B.
	Feels a chaotic place to live - feels disjointed, inability to move between a and b with no knowledge of the journey.

	Poverty and mental health and lack of opportunity traps people - cycle of deprivation.
	High quality amenities blended with high quality local shops.
	16-18 year olds lack things to do so why should they stay?
	Two different worlds: affluent and deprived.
	Net zero - how? walk or bus use? Stop people using their cars - it’s not difficult. It needs leadership.
	Leeds has taken its place. small community places, social enterprises, in the centre of Sheffield make it lively and different.
	Education: this is what you could do (net zero) building the community for collective action - individual won't help.
	Redesign and retrofit to be bold leaders. Keep it in-house in the city. Find a way to make it economically viable.
	Leadership process - why don't we have a fear driven community?
	Opportunity gap - why? Come from poverty, mental health - a very prevalent cycle of deprivation.
	How to move to being plastic free - link to 15 minute city - small steps to net zero. Show community project good experience.
	Hard to feel the different areas/neighbourhoods.
	Social isolation in affluent areas among women, not just a deprivation issue.
	Leah's yard, Kelham Island, retelling/reimagining the city, city centre residents could have their own visibility.
	What is the story of the city centre? theatre quarter/map area, no navigational map, themes needed.
	Social infrastructure in communities falling down with the cost of living crisis.
	Post covid isolation, students anxiety/vulnerable groups.
	No city centre, no triangle to move between - is this good? a USP? Celebrating here localities are good. Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham - Sheffield left behind.
	I deeply appreciate the park.
	Equality of access to high quality nature.
	Great city, huge potential but one of lowest performing.
	Birth defines outcomes. We should link deprived schools with apprenticeships.

	Not a political plan - a people’s plan.

	Some people, communities need support to connect or reconnect with nature.

	Rented housing issue for net zero.
	Fragmentation between these areas - not picked up by these groups.

	More mobile structure of power e.g. in terms of political office.

	Ensure diverse representation in museums and exhibition spaces in the city.

	The city is special because of its community spaces; so why aren’t more buildings and spaces opened up for the community to use?  
	By providing spaces for community groups, you also free up time for these groups which would otherwise be spent on the admin of trying to gain access to a space. This makes their work and support for each other have more impact.  
	Spaces should be opened up for effective student groups to continue their work in the city after graduation. Cite the work of Our Bodies Our Streets in creating a safer city. Could local political bodies such as the council also put more resources towards enabling this. Participants shared the case study of NEST in Newcastle: a student-led initiative which has now become a successful volunteering programme.  
	Would love to see more co-creation between the council and local politicians and the citizens.  
	Can derelict spaces be transformed into community hubs? There are examples of private contractors doing this for profit, but could council do this too for community initiatives. Other case studies show that by opening up spaces for community members, you can often reduce anti-social behaviours.

	City centre – Logistics – parking costs, food costs, cost of living.
	Depending where you live in Sheffield – some areas don’t need to come into the city centre because they are self sufficient in terms of outdoor recreation space.
	Huge difference in different areas – different depending on where you live.
	Keeping people – keeping young people, we need to have a busier city centre.
	Work opportunities for graduates are limited – people are moving away.
