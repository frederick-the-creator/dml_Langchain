# Initial User Stories for Theme Extraction Application

## User Story 1: Project Setup
**As a** developer  
**I want to** set up the initial project structure with all required dependencies  
**So that** I can start building the theme extraction application

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create a new Python project with the required directory structure
- Install all required dependencies from the BOM:
  - Python 3.13.3
  - Streamlit 1.44.1
  - LangChain 0.3.23
  - OpenAI 1.72.0
  - python-dotenv 1.1.0
  - pandas 2.2.3
- Set up a `.env` file template for storing API keys
- Create a README.md with basic project information and setup instructions

**Technical Notes:**
- Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies
- The project will be a Streamlit web application that uses LangChain and OpenAI for theme extraction
- Include instructions for setting up OpenAI API keys in the README

## User Story 2: Create Basic UI Shell
**As a** user  
**I want to** access a basic web interface  
**So that** I can see the application is working

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create a Streamlit application with a simple homepage
- Include a title and brief description of the application's purpose
- Add a file upload component that accepts multiple text files
- Display a placeholder message indicating where themes will appear
- Ensure the application runs without errors

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Streamlit's `st.file_uploader` with `accept=["text/plain"]` and `multiple=True` options
- The UI should be clean and minimal for this initial version
- No actual file processing or theme extraction is required for this story

## User Story 3: Implement Basic File Handling
**As a** user  
**I want to** upload text files to the application  
**So that** I can see they've been received (even if not yet processed)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Enhance the UI to show the names of uploaded files
- Add basic validation to ensure only text files are accepted
- Display a message confirming successful file upload
- Include a placeholder "Process Files" button
- When clicked, display a simple "Processing will be implemented in future stories" message

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Streamlit's session state to maintain the list of uploaded files
- Files should be temporarily stored in memory only for this initial version
- No actual theme extraction or LLM integration is needed yet
- This story completes our "Hello World" version of the application
