# User Stories for Requirement 2: File Processing

## Story 2.1: Implement Text File Upload Functionality

**As a** user,  
**I want to** upload multiple text files to the application,  
**So that** I can have their content analyzed for themes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The application accepts .txt files only
- Multiple files can be uploaded simultaneously
- The UI displays the names of successfully uploaded files
- The application provides feedback on successful uploads
- File size validation is implemented (reasonable limit: 5MB per file)
- Invalid file types are rejected with appropriate error messages

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Streamlit's `st.file_uploader` with `type="txt"` and `accept_multiple_files=True`
- Implement using Python 3.13.3 and Streamlit 1.44.1
- Store uploaded files temporarily in memory for processing
- Extend the existing implementation in `src/app.py`

## Story 2.2: Implement File Content Processing

**As a** user,  
**I want** the system to process and analyze the content of my uploaded text files,  
**So that** themes can be extracted from them.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The application reads and extracts text content from uploaded files
- The system processes each file's content for theme analysis
- The application handles text encoding properly (UTF-8)
- The system provides feedback during processing (progress indicator)
- Error handling for corrupted or unreadable files is implemented

**Technical Notes:**
- Create a new module `src/file_processor.py` to handle file processing logic
- Use Python's built-in file handling capabilities
- Implement progress tracking using Streamlit's progress indicators
- Use LangChain 0.3.23 for processing pipeline
- Integrate with the theme extraction workflow from workspace.ipynb
- Handle potential encoding issues with proper error messages

## Story 2.3: Maintain Source File Association

**As a** user,  
**I want** the system to maintain the association between extracted quotes and their source files,  
**So that** I can trace themes back to their original context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each extracted quote is linked to its source file name
- The UI displays the source file name alongside each quote
- When multiple files are processed, the system correctly attributes quotes to their respective files
- The data structure preserves file-quote relationships for potential export

**Technical Notes:**
- Extend the dataframe structure from the workspace.ipynb to include a "source_file" column
- Use pandas 2.2.3 for data structure management
- Create a data model that maintains the relationship between:
  - Themes
  - Quotes
  - Source files
- Implement in a new module `src/data_model.py`
- Ensure the LangChain processing pipeline preserves file origin information

## Story 2.4: Implement Processing Status Feedback

**As a** user,  
**I want** to see the status of file processing,  
**So that** I know when my files are being analyzed and when the analysis is complete.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The UI shows a loading indicator during file processing
- Progress updates are displayed for longer processing tasks
- The system notifies users when processing is complete
- Error messages are displayed if processing fails
- The UI remains responsive during processing

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Streamlit's `st.progress()` for progress bars
- Implement `st.spinner()` for loading indicators
- Use `st.success()` and `st.error()` for completion and error notifications
- Consider implementing asynchronous processing for larger files
- Add appropriate exception handling in the processing pipeline
- Ensure the UI updates in real-time using Streamlit's state management

## Story 2.5: Implement File Validation

**As a** user,  
**I want** the system to validate my uploaded files,  
**So that** I know if they can be properly processed before analysis begins.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system checks if uploaded files are valid text files
- Files that are too large receive appropriate error messages
- Empty files are detected and reported
- Files with unsupported encodings are identified
- The user receives clear feedback about validation issues

**Technical Notes:**
- Create validation functions in `src/file_processor.py`
- Implement size checks (max 5MB per file)
- Add content validation to ensure files contain readable text
- Use try/except blocks to catch encoding issues
- Provide specific error messages for different validation failures
- Return validation results to the main app for user feedback
