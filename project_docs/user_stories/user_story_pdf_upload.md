# User Story: PDF Document Upload Support

## As a user
I want to be able to upload PDF documents in addition to CSV files
So that I can process and analyze data from a wider range of document types within the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application UI allows users to select and upload PDF files, in addition to CSV files.
- Upon uploading a PDF, the application processes the document using LangChain's recommended approach for PDF handling (as outlined in the provided documentation).
- The text content of the PDF is extracted and made available for downstream processing (e.g., analysis, summarization, or taxonomy generation).
- The system gracefully handles errors (e.g., unsupported PDF formats, corrupted files) and provides meaningful feedback to the user.
- Uploaded PDFs are treated with the same level of security and privacy as CSV files.

## Notes
- Refer to the attached LangChain PDF documentation for the recommended approach to PDF handling.
- Ensure the user experience for uploading PDFs is as seamless as for CSVs.
